/**

Proposal:
- Rename Handler to EventHandler
- Remove Executors, and introduce CommandHandlers and Executions

- CommandHandlers run Commands
- Commands are submitted by users via the bot/slack etc...
- CommandHandlers can register bot intent
- CommandHandlers/Commands can have access to secrets
- They are basically the things that @cd uses to do all his fancy botlets.

- Both Event and Command Handlers return Plan | Message
- Plan can contain Executions.
- Executions represent deferred execution
  of some function that (currently) lives in the JVM in the ExecutionRegistry
  (formally CommandRegistry?).
- Success/Errors from Executions can be handled by registering callbacks.
  These callbacks return Plans too!
- Queries are (nearly) always performed via PathExpressions
   - A query is a non-side-effecting retrieval of some data

- Success/Error responses are in a standard format (as per HTTP)
   - code
   - status
   - body - this can be anything at all, even a JVM object

Rationale:
- Easy to explain: rugs can be done via CLI, Handlers are at runtime
- Programming model is asynchronous everywhere!
- First class bot Commands required!
- Executors model was confusing

QUESTION:
- Ideally these Execution callbacks would be serializable such that we can store and run them elsewhere/later
- How do we get things like the PXE in to CommandHandlers?
   - perhaps a "context" type thing with the PXE and other stuff on it?
- Should reviewers be exposed via PXE?
- Should we externalise parameter definitions for rugs and make them common across DSL and TS?
- How do we remove the duplication/guessing around parameter declarations?
- How do we easily allow chaining of executions (if at all)?
   - allow onSuccess also be an execution?
- jess: why aren't messages just executions?
TODO:
- Add error/success callbacks to editors/generators/reviewers
