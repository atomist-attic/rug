/**

Proposal:
- Rename Handler to EventHandler
- Remove Executors, and introduce CommandHanders and ResponseHandlers

- CommandHandlers, ResponseHandlers and EventHandlers are like rugs in that they
  are addressible in Rug Runner (lives in a Rug archive and has a name etc.)

- CommandHandlers:
   - Invoked by the user via slack/bot (currently)
   - Can register bot intent
   - Can have access to secrets (or perhaps Executions should deal with these?)
   - They are basically the things that @cd uses to do all his fancy botlets.

- EventHandlers
   - These are what the current Handlers are. They determine a plan of action in response to system events.

- ResponseHandlers
   - Are used to handle the responses from other Instructions (Editors, Executions, etc.)

- EventHandlers, ResponseHandlers and CommandHandlers all return a Plan or a Message

- Plans
  - Are pure data responses from CommandHandlers, ResponseHandlers and EventHandlers
  - They can contain things that are 'Plannable'

- Plannable things include: Edit | Generate | Review | Execute | Command
   - These are Instructions used in Plans to address other Rugs (editors, generators etc.)
- Executions represent deferred execution
  of some function that (currently) lives in the JVM in the ExecutionRegistry
  (formally CommandRegistry?).
- Success/Errors from Executions can be handled by registering ResponseHandlers
  These are like callbacks, but are named like other rugs and return Plans too!
- Queries are (nearly) always performed via PathExpressions

- ResponseHandlers
  - Success/Error responses are in a standard format (as per HTTP)
  - code
  - status
  - body - this can be anything at all and is what is returned by the execution of a Rug
