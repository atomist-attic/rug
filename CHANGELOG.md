All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

[Unreleased]: https://github.com/atomist/rug/compare/0.10.0...HEAD

### Added

-   Support for a new TS (JS) Handler programming model as per
    https://github.com/atomist/rug/issues/105

-   Support for Type extensions/TreeNode written in TypeScript as
    per https://github.com/atomist/rug/issues/214

### Fixed

-   TS generators are now passed project name as second argument as
    per TS contract

-   Retain all changes from an editor
    https://github.com/atomist/rug/issues/199

### Changed

-   **BREAKING** all JS based Rugs must export (a la Common-JS) vars implementing
    the associated interfaces. Previously we scanned for all top level vars.

-   **BREAKING** Remove Executor support from Rug DSL as per:
    https://github.com/atomist/rug/issues/206
    
-   TypeScript editors now return void. Use the new
    `ProjectMutableView` `describeChange` method to add any comments
    about the working of your editor.
    
-   **BREAKING** CustomizingProjectGenerator was removed from
    ProjectGenerator.ts as it's no longer required, and it's thought
    that it's not being used at all yet.

-   **BREAKING** signature of TypeScript ProjectGenerator.populate()
    changed: parameter `projectName` got removed. Name of the
    generated project can be obtained via `project.name()`.

-   Core.ts is generated and compiled on-the-fly during unit-testing
    so that the build is not dependent on network or later maven
    phases until deployment

## [0.10.0]

[0.10.0]: https://github.com/atomist/rug/compare/0.9.0...0.10.0

### Added

-   Parameter validation regex `@version_range`

-   ScriptExceptions during initial eval of JavaScript now include
    filename

-   EveryPom type curtesy of @justinedelson

### Changed

-   TypeScript/JavaScript should now "export" instances of Rugs inline
    with CommonJS standard.  Hopefully not a breaking change as there
    is limited support for automatically exporting legacy ones.

### Fixed

-   Comments are removed from JS files as they are 'required', and
    relative imports now work correctly when 'export' is used from TS
    or vars are added to the global exports var
    https://github.com/atomist/rug/issues/156

-   Generation of Rug types documentation

-   minLength and maxLength now default to -1 as per Rug DSL
    https://github.com/atomist/rug/issues/169

    https://github.com/atomist/rug/issues/164

-   Default parameter values are now validated
    https://github.com/atomist/rug/issues/168

-   Output parameter name when pattern fails to validate
    https://github.com/atomist/rug/issues/58

### Removed

-   In the DSL, parameters no longer accept an array of allowed
    values for validation.
