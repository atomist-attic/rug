Valentine release

### Added

    YmlFileType respectively. Deprecated the latter classes.
-   Support PathExpressions that start with a NodesWithTag
-   Support for `contains` and `starts-with` path expression functions
-   Beginning of a TypeScript class library to simplify working with
    tree nodes and transparently decorate tree nodes if a decoration
    strategy is provided in TypeScript.

    decorators. e.g. EditProject
-   Added support for @Editor, @Generator, @Reviewer and @Tags class
    decorators in TS.

-   Raise an `InvalidRugTestScenarioName` when a Rug test scenario is
    missing a name #71
-   Implicit DLS parameters (from `uses`) are no longer duplicate if
    multiple editors declare the same parameter. The first one is
    chosen [#258][258]
-   Ensure TS parameters are required by default, and ensure defaults
    are applied before validation [#224][224]

[258]: https://github.com/atomist/rug/issues/258
[224]: https://github.com/atomist/rug/issues/224

### Changed

-   Upgrade TS compiler to 2.1.5
-   `scalar` method on TypeScript `PathExpressionEngine` taking string
    is now called `scalarStr`. This change was necessary to avoid
    conflicts with method overloading in TypeScript/JavaScript.

    to customize the display of each node.
-   **BREAKING** `value`, `update` and `formatInfo` functions from
    TypeScript `TreeNode` moved to new `TextTreeNode` sub-interface.
-   **BREAKING** The interface for Rug extensions, formerly Rug types,
    was simplified.  resolvesFromNodeTypes was eliminated and the
    signature for findAllIn was simplified.  They should also directly
    extend ChildResolver instead of some sort of ViewFinder.

-   We now create a new JS rug for each thread for safety [#78][78]

    the associated interfaces. Previously we scanned for all top level vars.

    `ProjectMutableView` `describeChange` method to add any comments

    ProjectGenerator.ts as it's no longer required, and it's thought
    that it's not being used at all yet.
-   **BREAKING** signature of TypeScript ProjectGenerator.populate()
    changed: parameter `projectName` got removed. Name of the
    generated project can be obtained via `project.name()`.
-   Core.ts is generated and compiled on-the-fly during unit-testing
    so that the build is not dependent on network or later maven
    phases until deployment
-   Scala compiler warnings are now fatal by default, use `-P
    allow-warnings` profile to have the old behavior.  The Travis CI
    build uses the allow-warnings profile.
